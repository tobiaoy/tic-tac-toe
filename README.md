## Retrospective
- This project was completed as part of the Odin Project Curriculum.
- Initially, it was difficult to get the hang of the modular pattern, especially considering the prompt.
However, as I progressed, it became clear how the pattern helps in organizing code and managing scope and variables.

Through this project, I: 
1. Learned how to apply the modular pattern and implement closures
2. Learned to use factory functions
3. Improved my understanding of scope
4. Improved my understanding of DOM manipulation
